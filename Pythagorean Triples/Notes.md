# Definition

A Pythagorean triple is a triple of positive integers (a, b, c) where a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>  = c<sup>2</sup> 
* Examples include (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), and (8, 15, 17)
* Some Pythagorean triples are scalar multiples of other triples: (6, 8, 10) is twice (3, 4, 5)
* We call a triple (a, b, c) **primitive** when the three integers have no common factor.
* if d is **the greatest common divisor** of all three terms then (a/d, b/d, c/d) is a primitive triple and the original triple is a scalar multiple of this,
   * so finding all Pythagorean triples is basically the same as finding all primitive Pythagorean triples.
